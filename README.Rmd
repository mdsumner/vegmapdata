# vegmapdata

The goal of vegmapdata is to provide a fast and simple compromise to accessing
TASVEG polygon classifications. 

WORK IN PROGRESS


The basic idea is to have the data frame of fields, and a nicely compressed GeoTIFF version of the data frame row IDs. Currently at 10m resolution only. 
(See /data-raw/). 

TODO

rerun the script to put the UTM zone CRS on properly, the GeoTIFF is currently un-crs ready because I read the geometry on its own. (Use "+init=epsg:32755"). 
How to use? 

pseudocode: 

```{r vegmap-lookup, eval = FALSE}
r <- raster(rasterfile)
d <- readRDS(datafile)

ids <- raster::extract(r, mypts)

## data attributes
mytps$vegcode <- d[ids, c("VEGCODE"), drop = FALSE]
```
